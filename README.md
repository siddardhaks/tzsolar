# tzsolar
A Python library for timezones across the solar system.

I got this idea when I was watching the first Falcon Heavy launch (with 'Starman' in it) and also fixing a timezone-related bug in another project at the same time. If we are going to have some presence in Mars, we need to be able to handle Martian timezones. And if we are writing code to handle Martian timezone, we should be able to handle other planets in the Solar System too.
